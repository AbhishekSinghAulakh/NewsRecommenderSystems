# NewsRecommenderSystems
The repository serves the code for Recommender Systems using Popularity, Collaborative Filtering, Content-based and ALS techniques for users interacting with online news aggregator platforms

In the code we will be trying to solve the issue of revenue leakage and user drop for online news platforms by personalising user tastes and introducing new content to its users at the start of the day on the home page of the application.

The plan will be to assess these recommendations by tracking whether the user clicks on those items or not. Moreover, once the user clicks on any news item A, it wants to recommend news similar to the news A, at the bottom of the page of the news item A.

The recommender systems are built using **CI&T dataset** with news articles from number of websites with topics around sports, politics, technology and many others.

Our code will build an appropriate recommendation system that would:

Recommend new top 10 relevant articles to a user when he visits the app at the start of the day Recommend top 10 similar news articles that match the ones clicked by the user.

The code project will try out below methods for feeding personalised news recommendation to users on the online news platform

Popularity method
Collobartive Filtering
Content Based Filtering
ALS
Hybrid systems
